    "1. Create variables of each of Python's scalar types:\n",
    "    * Integer\n",
    "    * Floating-point number\n",
    "    * String\n",
    "    * Boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write Python code to demonstrate the following string operations:\n",
    "    * Concatenation\n",
    "    * Slicing to extract a substring\n",
    "    * Finding the index of a specific character\n",
    "    * Converting a string to uppercase\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explain the difference between the / and // operators in Python. Provide code examples to illustrate their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. Use a for loop and conditional statements to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Demonstrate the usage of the if, elif, and else statements in Python to implement a simple decision-making logic based on user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write Python code using a while loop to calculate the factorial of a given number."
